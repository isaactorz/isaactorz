Software Engineer based out of Albuquerque, NM :cactus:.

I mostly code in C/C++, Rust, and Python, but I consider myself a polyglot.

I'm currently obsessed with build systems, and working on developing the next generation of Build & CI systems at [Swift Navigation](https://www.swiftnav.com).

Previously I worked on physics based modeling and simulation software.

Some tech I'm interested in learning more about; Nix, Bazel, Haskell, Yocto.
